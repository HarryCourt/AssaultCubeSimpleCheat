# AssaultCubeSimpleCheat
A simple cheat for AssaultCube that uses **Memory.dll**.

Using the .NET Framework Console, I made this as a way to teach myself how to create trainers for games. Not much I really plan at the moment.

Free to use in anyway. I'm not the first to do this.

# To Do List
- [x] Create a repository.
- [ ] Place offesets into another file for tidyness.
- [ ] Create bindings to enable and disable functions.
- [ ] Comment code for easier explanation.
- [ ] Change Offsets to `public const int`'s.
- [ ] Create an ESP(?)


# Q&A

**Q. This cheat is extremely basic, why are you putting it up here when I can go find another more complex cheat?**<br/>
A. I wanted to create this as a way to ease myself into creating a trainer for other games. I don't expect you to use this cheat, espicially when there is more detailed and complex trainers.

**Q. Why have you done this in a console instead of a Windows Form?**<br/>
A. Besides lacking the design skills to make a decent-looking trainer, I really like the feel and look of a console, espicially ones that have coloured text on them.
