# AssaultCubeSimpleCheat
A simple cheat for AssaultCube that uses **Memory.dll**.

Using the .NET Framework Console, I made this as a way to teach myself how to create trainers for games. Not much I really plan at the moment.

Free to use in anyway. I'm not the first to do this.

# To Do List
- [x] Create a repository.
- [ ] Place offesets into another file for tidyness.
- [ ] Comment code for easier explanation.
- [ ] Change Offsets to `public const int`'s
- [ ] Create an ESP(?)
